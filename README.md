# GRBL for arduino CNC shield

This fork of the grbl repository keeps compatibility with the [arduino CNC shield developed by protoneer](https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield/).

# Installation

1. Copy the 'grbl' folder into the Arduino library folder (e.g. Documents/Arduino/libraries/grbl).
2. Open the arduino sketch editor and load the loader example from the grbl library examples. If the library does not show up, the example sketch can be found in grbl/examples/grblUpload/.
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino UNO board. This should compile the project.

# Testing and first run

Follow the instructions on the [arduino CNC shield website](https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield-v3-00-assembly-guide/).
